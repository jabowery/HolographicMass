# Haramein Theory Analysis - Mathematica Notebooks

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks analyzing theoretical physics claims related to Nassim Haramein's "Holographic Mass" theory, with particular focus on fundamental particle properties and their derivations.

## Files Overview

### HMDebunk.nb
**Purpose**: Critical analysis of theoretical claims regarding fundamental constants and particle masses

**Key Contents**:
- Examination of claims that electron mass is an "algebraic consequence" of accepted definitions
- Analysis of the Bohr radius definition and its relationship to fundamental constants
- Evaluation of proton radius predictions using Haramein's 2013 formula
- Comparison with CODATA reference values

**Notable Results**:
- Shows that eliminating certain constants from standard definitions yields constraints but not direct derivations
- Demonstrates ~0.2% agreement between Haramein's proton radius formula and experimental values
- Provides critical assessment of theoretical claims about fundamental constant relationships

- Planck Scale Unit (PSU) definitions and relationships
- Surface area to volume ratios in holographic frameworks
- Mass scaling relationships based on geometric principles

**Core Equations Implemented**:
- PSU radius as half the Planck length
- Holographic surface area relationships
- Mass derivations using geometric scaling factors
- Connections between microscopic and macroscopic scales

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- Mathematica 13.0 or later
- CODATAstuff.wl package (custom physics constants library)
- Standard Mathematica physics and mathematics packages

### Data Sources
- CODATA 2018 fundamental physical constants
- Experimental measurements from peer-reviewed sources

## Critical Assessment

These notebooks provide computational tools for examining theoretical claims in alternative physics frameworks. The analysis reveals:

1. **Mathematical Consistency**: Many derivations are mathematically self-consistent within their frameworks
2. **Empirical Accuracy**: Some predictions show remarkable agreement with experiment, while others show significant deviations
3. **Theoretical Foundation**: Questions remain about the fundamental justifications for key assumptions

## Usage

1. Ensure Mathematica is installed with required packages
2. Load the CODATAstuff.wl package in the working directory
3. Execute notebooks in sequence: HMQGHM.nb → HMElectron.nb → HMDebunk.nb
4. Review numerical outputs and compare with standard physics predictions

## Disclaimer

These notebooks are provided for scientific analysis and educational purposes. They implement mathematical relationships from various theoretical frameworks without endorsing their validity. Users should critically evaluate all results and compare with established physics literature.
